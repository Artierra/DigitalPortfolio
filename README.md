# DigitalPortfolio
This is a website to showcase my progress learning to create the websites.

I have included 4 websites in this initial portfolio website
The Crystals numbers game and trivia questions  are simple games created from "scratch". 
Muddy Fork Farm is one is a commercial website created using prebuilt templates from the site-builder  square space.
The love calculator and poem generator site was created as a group project at Case Western Reserve  University, bootcamp.
