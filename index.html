            <p>My background as an artist brought me to website development. As a painter, photographer and potter I
                understand that good mastery of the tools and techniques of the craft are essential. To elevate a
                pottery piece to a piece of art, a snapshot to a memorable photograph worth of display, to render an oil
                painting with soul requires practice and knowledge. Art is not a gift we are given, it is the result of
                study, hard work and passion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My scientific background led me to seek understanding of computer languages, software, and
                implementation of these tools correctly. With that in mind I embarked on learning the tools of the
                trade, becoming a full stack developer. I like to be able to work both with the front end and the
                back end of the process. I understand the technology to create a website, have the visual skills of an
                artist to make it beautiful and the ability to write content that expresses compelling messages.
